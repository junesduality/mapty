- - PROJECT PLANNING - -
1). USER STORIES (High level overview)
  This is a description of the app's functionality from the user's perspective. All user stories put together describe the entire app.
2). FEATURES 
3). FLOWCHART 
  WHAT we will build.
4). ARCHITECTURE
  HOW we will build it. There are a plethora of ways to go about building an app, so having a set-in-stone plan prevents you from creating a mess of unorganized code.
5). DEVELOPMENT STEP (The implementation using code).

- - USER STORIES - -
  Common Format: As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]
    * Answers the questions who, what, and why
    e.g.
       As a user, I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace, and steps/minute, so I can keep a log of all my running.

       As a user I want to log my cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed, and elevation gain, so I can keep a lot of all my cycling.

       As a user, I want to see all my workouts at a glance, so I can easily track my progress over time.

       As a user, I want to also see my workouts on a mpa, so I can easily check where I work out the most.

       As a user, I want to see all my workouts when I leave the app and come back later, so that I can keep using their app over time.

  3). Form to input distance, time, pace, steps/minute
  4). Form to input distance, time, speed, elevation
  5). Display all workouts in a list
  6). Display all workous on the map
  7). Store workout data in the browser
  8). On page load, read the saved data from local storage and display

  This doesn't need to be completely set up in the beginning, since later down the line it may change.
